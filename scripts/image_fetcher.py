"""Multi-strategy image fetcher for bird species photos.

Four live strategies + a fallback:
  1. Macaulay Library Search internal JSON API (returns assetId + photographer).
  2. eBird species page meta tags (og:image + og:image:alt). Requires a
     Session because eBird's CAS gateway needs cookies to resolve redirects.
  3. iNaturalist, through its public taxa API: the taxon's default photo,
     when its author has put a Creative Commons licence on it.
  4. Wikimedia Commons, through the Wikipedia article for the scientific
     name: a photograph of a live bird from that article, with author and
     licence from the file page.
  5. Fallback: link to ML Search without an inline image.

    Strategy order, with rationale:

    1. **eBird species page og:image** — the photo eBird's editors have
       chosen as the canonical hero for that species. This is what a
       human visiting ``https://ebird.org/species/{code}`` sees, so it
       is the photo readers expect to be served.
    2. **Macaulay Library Search API** — the highest-rated photo from
       the public catalog. Reached when eBird hasn't curated a hero
       (rare; tends to happen with very recent splits or obscure
       endemics). Reliable fallback because it returns *something*
       whenever Macaulay has any photo at all.
    3. **iNaturalist** — the default photo of the taxon named
       ``scientific_name``, when it carries a Creative Commons licence.
       Reached when Cornell answers neither of the above, which since its
       bot gateways went up is most days on a CI runner. Ahead of Commons
       because iNaturalist photographs are of observations, nearly
       always of a live bird, where Commons files museum skins too.
    4. **Wikimedia Commons** — a photograph from the Wikipedia article
       for ``scientific_name``, freely licensed, credited with author and
       licence, specimens, drawings and maps declined.
    5. **No image + link to ML Search** — last-resort fallback. The
       reader can click through to find a photo manually.

    Earlier revisions had the order reversed (rating-first), which
    surfaced the highest-rated Macaulay photo regardless of eBird's
    curation. That picked technically beautiful but unfamiliar shots
    instead of the photo readers expected to see.

    ``locale`` is forwarded to the eBird species-page strategy. The
    Macaulay API strategy doesn't take a locale (asset metadata is
    language-agnostic).

    ``ordinal`` is how many times this species has been published before.
    On a republication the curated eBird hero is skipped: it is a single
    fixed photograph, and showing it twice is exactly what the ordinal
    exists to avoid. The rated Macaulay list is walked instead, past every
    asset in ``seen_asset_ids``. If the library has nothing new the normal
    order runs anyway: repeating a photograph beats publishing without one.
