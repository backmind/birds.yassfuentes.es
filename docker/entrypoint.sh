# Sequence:
#   1. Ensure the state directory exists and is writable.
#   2. If feed.xml is missing (cold start on a fresh volume), run the
#      generator synchronously so the first request gets a real page.
#   3. Launch supercronic in the background for the daily refresh.
#   4. exec into the CMD (typically nginx) so it becomes PID 1's child
#      under tini, with proper signal forwarding.
