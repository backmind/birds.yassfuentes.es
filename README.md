A daily bird species RSS feed and minimal static site, self-hostable as a
microservice. Each day a new species is selected from a configurable
weighted pool of regions, scraped from public Cornell Lab sources, and
published to a GitHub Pages site plus an RSS endpoint.

The default deployment ships Iberian-weighted: Madrid 35%, Spain 27%,
one random European country 23%, global taxonomy 15%. All weights live
in `data/config.json`. Spanish is the default language. English, French
and Portuguese are bundled. Adding another language is one JSON file
under `data/i18n/`.

Zero AI-generated content, zero hosting cost (free tier of GitHub Actions
and GitHub Pages), zero tracking, zero cookies.

## Endpoints

GitHub Pages serves three static routes from the repository root:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/` (`index.html`) | Hero of the day's bird + a grid of the most recent twelve |
| `/archive.html` | Every published bird in reverse chronological order, with permanent anchors (`#bird-{code}-{date}`) |
| `/feed.xml` | RSS 2.0 feed with rich `content:encoded` HTML |

Everything is server-rendered HTML — no JavaScript framework, no build
step. The single small piece of vanilla JS is an inline theme switcher
that persists light/dark preference in `localStorage`.

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions (cron daily 07:00 UTC)
  │
  ├─ 1. Pool weighted by date (e.g. 35% Madrid, 27% Spain,
  │     23% one random European country, 15% global taxonomy)
  ├─ 2. Species selection biased toward rarer observations,
  │     deduplicated against the last 50 publications
  ├─ 3. Photo + photographer from Macaulay Library Search API
  │     (with fallback to og:image on the eBird species page)
  ├─ 4. Description chain in the configured language:
  │     eBird Merlin → Wikipedia → policy-driven fallback
  ├─ 5. Wikipedia URL captured (target language → English fallback)
  │     so the footer link is always present
  ├─ 6. feed.xml + index.html + archive.html written
  └─ 7. git commit + git push → GitHub Pages republishes
```

The selection is **deterministic by date**: two runs on the same day pick
exactly the same species. The script bails early if today's entry is
already in `history.json`, so the daily cron and ad-hoc reruns don't
duplicate work.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+, managed with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Three runtime dependencies: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `langid`
- No database. State lives in three files in the repo: `feed.xml`,
  `history.json`, `cache/`

## Local installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/backmind/Bird-of-the-day.git
cd Bird-of-the-day
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates the venv at `.venv/` and installs the dependencies from
`pyproject.toml`.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `EBIRD_API_KEY` | yes | Free at <https://ebird.org/api/keygen> |

For local use copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env
```

`.env` is gitignored and `generate.py` loads it automatically (no
`python-dotenv` required).

In GitHub Actions the key is injected from `Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions → New repository secret` with the same name.

### `data/config.json`

Every behavior knob lives here. Annotated example:

```json
{
  "language": "es",
  "_language_help": "One of es | en | fr | pt (or any other catalog you add).",

  "ebird_locale": null,
  "_ebird_locale_help": "Optional override for the eBird API locale (e.g. 'pt_BR'). If null, derived from `language`.",

  "description_policy": "foreign_fallback",
  "_description_policy_help": "How to render descriptions when no source produces text in the configured language. One of: strict | foreign_fallback | skip.",
  "max_skip_retries": 50,

  "pools": [
    {"id": "madrid", "region": "ES-MD", "weight": 0.35, "type": "regional"},
    {"id": "spain",  "region": "ES",    "weight": 0.27, "type": "regional"},
    {"id": "europe", "weight": 0.23, "type": "europe_random",
     "countries": ["PT", "FR", "IT", "DE", "GB", "GR", "SE", "NO", "PL"]},
    {"id": "global", "weight": 0.15, "type": "global_taxonomy"}
  ],
  "dedup_window": 50,
  "max_feed_entries": 60,
  "back_days": 14,

  "feed_link": "https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Bird-of-the-day/"
}
```

Keys starting with `_` are documentation-only and ignored at load time.

### Description policy

What happens when none of the sources (eBird Merlin, target-language
Wikipedia) returns text in your configured language:

| Policy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `foreign_fallback` (default) | Show the original text with a disclaimer naming the source language (e.g. *"Description in English (no French translation available)"*). |
| `strict` | Show an em-dash placeholder. Never display foreign text. |
| `skip` | Re-roll species selection up to `max_skip_retries` times. On exhaustion, falls back to `strict`. |

Even with `strict`, the footer always carries a Wikipedia link — falling
back to English Wikipedia (and labeled `Wikipedia (en)`) if the target
language has no article.

The `site.tagline` and `feed.description` strings in `data/i18n/*.json`
are intentionally generic ("A new bird species every day."): the regional
flavor of the site is decided by `pools` in `data/config.json`, not baked
into the copy. If you want a region-specific tagline, edit the catalog of
the language you're shipping in.

## Running

### Locally

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.generate
```

This:

1. Loads `.env` if present.
2. Loads the i18n catalog for the configured language.
3. Bails early if today's entry is already in `history.json`.
4. Selects the species, fetches image and content (writing to `cache/`).
5. Writes `feed.xml`, `index.html`, `archive.html`.
6. Updates `history.json`.

To force a regeneration of today's entry, empty the history:

```bash
echo '{"entries": []}' > history.json
uv run python -m scripts.generate
```

### Via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/ave-del-dia.yml` runs:

- Automatically every day at **07:00 UTC** (09:00 CEST in Madrid).
- Manually from the **Actions → Bird of the Day → Run workflow** tab.

The workflow `git add`s `feed.xml`, `history.json`, `index.html`,
`archive.html` and `cache/`, then commits with a message of the form
`🐦 Bird of the day: 2026-04-11` and pushes to the default branch. The
file path keeps the historical `ave-del-dia.yml` name so existing GitHub
Actions history isn't lost.

## Self-hosting

Two paths, pick whichever fits your taste. They are peer options, not
replacements: pick GitHub Pages if you want a free hosted site with zero
ops, or Docker if you run your own server.

| Path | Best for | Cost | Ops |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions + Pages | "I just want a free site." | Free | None |
| Docker container | "I run my own server / VPS / Pi / fly.io." | A host with Docker | Standard container ops |

### Self-hosting with Docker

The image is published to `ghcr.io/backmind/bird-of-the-day` for
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. It runs nginx on port 8080 and a
built-in cron (supercronic) that regenerates the site daily at 07:00 UTC,
matching the GitHub Actions cadence. Total image size: ~340 MB.

#### Quick start

```bash
docker run -d --name bird-of-the-day \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e EBIRD_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -v botd-data:/var/lib/botd \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/backmind/bird-of-the-day:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. On a fresh container the first request may
take 30–60 seconds while the generator runs synchronously to populate
the volume.

#### Docker Compose

A ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` lives at the repo root with sensible
defaults (named volume, healthcheck, `cap_drop: ALL`,
`no-new-privileges`). Set `EBIRD_API_KEY` in your shell or a sibling
`.env` file and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Configuration via environment variables

Scalar config knobs can be tweaked without rebuilding the image or
mounting a custom config file. Each maps to a key in `data/config.json`
and overrides it if set:

| Env var | Maps to | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `BOTD_LANGUAGE` | `language` | `en`, `fr`, `pt` |
| `BOTD_EBIRD_LOCALE` | `ebird_locale` | `pt_BR` |
| `BOTD_DESCRIPTION_POLICY` | `description_policy` | `strict`, `foreign_fallback`, `skip` |
| `BOTD_MAX_SKIP_RETRIES` | `max_skip_retries` | `50` |
| `BOTD_DEDUP_WINDOW` | `dedup_window` | `50` |
| `BOTD_MAX_FEED_ENTRIES` | `max_feed_entries` | `60` |
| `BOTD_BACK_DAYS` | `back_days` | `14` |
| `BOTD_FEED_LINK` | `feed_link` | `https://example.com/birds/` |

`EBIRD_API_KEY` is required. The container does **not** read `.env`
files (it doesn't need to — env vars work everywhere).

#### Secrets via files (Docker / Kubernetes secrets)

Standard Docker / k8s secrets convention: instead of passing the key as
an env var, mount a file containing the key and point at it with
`EBIRD_API_KEY_FILE`:

```bash
docker run ... \
  --secret source=ebird_api_key,target=/run/secrets/ebird_api_key \
  -e EBIRD_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/ebird_api_key \
  ghcr.io/backmind/bird-of-the-day
```

In Kubernetes, mount a Secret as a volume and set
`EBIRD_API_KEY_FILE` to the mounted path. If both `EBIRD_API_KEY` and
`EBIRD_API_KEY_FILE` are set, the env var wins.

#### Mounting a custom `data/config.json`

The `pools` matrix is a nested structure not exposed via env vars
(stringifying it would be painful). To customise it without forking
the repo and rebuilding:

```bash
# 1. Pull the default config out of a running container
docker cp bird-of-the-day:/app/data/config.json ./my-config.json

# 2. Edit my-config.json on the host

# 3. Mount it back in:
docker run -d ... \
  -v ./my-config.json:/app/data/config.json:ro \
  ghcr.io/backmind/bird-of-the-day
```

The mount is `:ro` (read-only) — the container only reads it.

#### Volume contents

The single volume at `/var/lib/botd` holds all mutable state:

```
/var/lib/botd/
├── cache/         # per-species + taxonomy caches
├── feed.xml       # the RSS feed
├── index.html     # the front page
├── archive.html   # the chronological archive
└── history.json   # the full publication history
```

Back this up and you can rebuild the running container without losing a
single day. The default schedule writes to it once per day at 07:00 UTC.

#### Health checks

The container's `HEALTHCHECK` verifies three things every 5 minutes:

1. `feed.xml` exists on the volume.
2. `feed.xml` was modified within the last 36 hours.
3. nginx is actually serving `/feed.xml` on port 8080.

If the daily cron silently stops working, the container goes
`unhealthy` within 36 hours — that's the **intended** behavior, and
your orchestrator (k8s / docker swarm / fly machines / etc.) will
surface it. The 36 h window gives the daily 07:00 UTC run a 12 h grace
period.

There's also a cheap liveness probe at `/healthz` that just returns
`200 ok` if nginx is up.

#### Hardened deployment

The container runs as a non-root user (`botd`, uid 1000) and needs no
Linux capabilities. Recommended hardening for security-conscious
deployments:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --tmpfs /var/log/nginx \
  --tmpfs /var/lib/nginx \
  --tmpfs /run/nginx \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e EBIRD_API_KEY=$KEY \
  -v botd-data:/var/lib/botd \
  ghcr.io/backmind/bird-of-the-day
```

The `--read-only` root filesystem requires writable `tmpfs` for
nginx's working directories. The container has been tested in this
mode end-to-end.

Resource hints: ~50–100 MB RAM at idle, ~150 MB during generation,
bursty CPU. A floor of `mem_limit: 256m` and `cpus: 0.5` is
comfortable.

#### Building locally

```bash
docker build -t bird-of-the-day .
# Multi-arch:
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t bird-of-the-day .
```

#### Cron schedule and timezone

The container is UTC by default. The cron expression in
`docker/crontab` is `0 7 * * *` (07:00 UTC, matching the GitHub
Actions workflow). To change it, edit that file and rebuild — or
mount your own at `/etc/supercronic/crontab`.

### Self-hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Fork the repo.
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** → add `EBIRD_API_KEY`.
3. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment** → source: `Deploy from a
   branch`, branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`. Save.
4. Edit `data/config.json`:
   - Set `feed_link` to your `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` URL.
   - Pick a `language` (or add one — see below).
   - Adjust `pools` if you want different regional weights.
5. Reset the inherited state (see "Forking from this deployment" below).
6. Either wait for the cron or trigger **Actions → Bird of the Day → Run
   workflow** manually for the first publication.

#### Forking from this deployment

The state of `backmind/Bird-of-the-day` (`history.json`, `cache/`, the
rendered `index.html`/`archive.html`/`feed.xml`) is committed to its
`main` branch. That is how the GitHub Pages flow keeps state between
cron runs without an external database — git is the database.

The consequence: when you fork, you inherit the upstream's state. You
should reset it to a clean slate before the first publication, or your
first cron run will start from someone else's history.

```bash
rm -f feed.xml index.html archive.html history.json
rm -f cache/*.json cache/*.image.json   # cache/.gitkeep stays
echo '{"entries": []}' > history.json
# edit data/config.json: language, pools, feed_link
git add -A && git commit -m "reset for fresh deployment"
git push
```

Optional: keep `cache/taxonomy.json` if you want to skip the first
~5 MB taxonomy fetch on the next cron run. It is language-tagged
internally and will be re-fetched automatically if your `language`
differs from the cached one.

The Docker deployment does not have this problem: the image ships with
state excluded via `.dockerignore`, and the persistent volume starts
empty on first run.

### Pool matrix examples

The default leans Iberian. Some alternative presets you can paste into
`data/config.json`:

**Western US flavor:**

```json
"pools": [
  {"id": "california", "region": "US-CA", "weight": 0.35, "type": "regional"},
  {"id": "us_west",    "region": "US",    "weight": 0.27, "type": "regional"},
  {"id": "americas",   "weight": 0.23, "type": "europe_random",
   "countries": ["MX", "CA", "CR", "BR", "AR", "CO", "EC", "PE", "CL"]},
  {"id": "global",     "weight": 0.15, "type": "global_taxonomy"}
]
```

**Pan-European balance (no national bias):**

```json
"pools": [
  {"id": "europe", "weight": 0.85, "type": "europe_random",
   "countries": ["ES", "PT", "FR", "IT", "DE", "GB", "GR", "SE", "NO", "PL", "NL", "BE", "AT", "CH", "DK", "FI"]},
  {"id": "global", "weight": 0.15, "type": "global_taxonomy"}
]
```

The `type` field accepts `regional` (single region code) or
`europe_random` (list of countries, one picked per day) or
`global_taxonomy` (any species in the eBird taxonomy).

### Adding a new language

1. Copy `data/i18n/en.json` to `data/i18n/{lang}.json` (use the ISO 639-1
   code, e.g. `de`, `it`, `ca`).
2. Translate every value. Missing keys fall back to English at render
   time, so partial translations are safe.
3. Add the language name in your file, plus the names of every other
   supported language as seen from your language. For example, in `de.json`:
   ```json
   "language_name.es": "Spanisch",
   "language_name.en": "Englisch",
   "language_name.fr": "Französisch",
   "language_name.pt": "Portugiesisch",
   "language_name.de": "Deutsch"
   ```
4. Set `language: "{lang}"` in your `data/config.json`.
5. **Clear `cache/*.json`** (but keep `cache/taxonomy.json`) so existing
   per-species caches don't render in the previous language.
6. Run `uv run python -m scripts.generate` and verify.
7. Open a PR.

`langid` (the language detector) supports 97 languages out of the box;
the only constraint on which target languages are valid is that there's a
`data/i18n/{lang}.json` file.
